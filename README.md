# Video Scroller

This is a basic intro to multimedia scrollytelling.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, work in progress

← `index.html`:
The example uses media from environmental activist Mina Guli's #runblue campaign to demonstrate a couple of scrollytelling techniques
with Goldenberg's Sticky Overlay tutorial to implement scrolling interactions with video and images.

← Styles for layout
This is a work in progress, and so I've included most of the styles needed to control layout of scrollytelling in the html file.

- A flexbox layout with image and text laid out side by side (adapted from Goldenberg's Sticky Overlay tutorial template)

← Javascript  
This example combines several techniques:

- A background video
- Scrollama - HTML dataset techniques (to swop images and captions) as explained in a Bill Shander LinkedIn tutorial on Scrollytelling
- Scrollama - Fading steps in and out and to handle resizing of the display window.
- Scrollama The example has lines to help you debug scrolling and other usability issues. Set debug="false" to get rid of the guidelines.

You can see this layout in combination with other techniques you've been taught in this more complex example.

← `style.css`: Basic styles for typography

← `scrollama.min.js`: Scrollama library - The scrollytelling functionality is here
