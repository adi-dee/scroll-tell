# Video Scroller

This is a basic intro to multimedia scrollytelling.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, work in progress

← `index.html`:

This example combines several techniques:
HTML dataset techniques (to swop images and captions) as explained in a Bill Shander LinkedIn tutorial on Scrollytelling
Javascript to fade steps in and out and handle resizing
A flexbox layout with image and text laid out side by side (uses the "Sticky Side Example" template)
background video

You can see this layout in combination with other techniques you've been taught in this more complex example.

← `style.css`: Basic styles for typography

← `scrollama.min.js`: Scrollama library - The scrollytelling functionality is here
